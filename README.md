Based on the Udemy course "Dart and Flutter: The Complete Developer's Guide"
https://www.udemy.com/course/dart-and-flutter-the-complete-developers-guide

## notes

Having started this course after Flutter null-safety was enabled by default
forced me to figure some things out differently from how the instructor
did them.  This was also true for the RXDart components since they have been
significantly updated since the source was published.

All in all, this was a decent course, but needs to be updated.
